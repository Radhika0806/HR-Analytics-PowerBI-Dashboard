# 👩‍💼 HR Dashboard

### 1. HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition & Workforce Intelligence
An interactive Business Intelligence dashboard built using Power BI to analyze employee attrition, workforce demographics, compensation trends, tenure patterns, and job satisfaction metrics. Designed to support data-driven HR decision-making and strategic workforce planning.

### 2. Purpose

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a technical Power BI solution developed to measure attrition rate, analyze department-level turnover, evaluate salary impact on employee exits, and identify workforce trends using DAX-based KPIs and relational data modeling. The project demonstrates end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization skills required for Data Analyst roles.

### 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Data visualization and interactive dashboard development<br>
• 📂 Power Query (M Language) – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation<br>
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creation of calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic logic<br>
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationship building, cross-filtering, and schema optimization <br>
• 📁 File Format – .pbix (development file) and .png (dashboard preview)

### 4. Data Source

*Source*: Structured HR Employee Dataset (tabular workforce data for analytics purposes)

The dataset includes employee-level information such as:<br>
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status)<br>
- Job details (Department, Job Role, Job Level, Years at Company)<br>
- Compensation (Monthly Income, Salary Bands)<br>
- Attrition Status (Yes/No)<br>
- Job Satisfaction & Performance Indicators<br>

The dataset is structured in a relational format to enable KPI calculation, filtering, and aggregation for business intelligence reporting.

### 5. Features / Highlights
• **Business Problem**

Employee attrition significantly impacts organizational productivity, hiring costs, and operational stability. HR teams often struggle to extract actionable insights from raw workforce datasets.

Critical business questions include:<br>
1) Which departments have the highest attrition rates?<br>
2) Does compensation influence employee turnover?<br>
3) Are early-tenure employees more likely to leave?<br>
4) How does job satisfaction correlate with attrition?<br>
5) What demographic patterns exist in workforce exits?<br>
6) Without structured analytics, these insights remain hidden in raw data.<br>

• **Goal of the Dashboard**

To design an interactive HR analytics solution that:<br>
1. Calculates and monitors Attrition Rate (%)<br>
2. Identifies department-wise turnover trends<br>
3. Analyzes salary band vs attrition correlation<br>
4. Evaluates tenure-based exit patterns<br>
5. Provides dynamic, filter-driven workforce insights<br>
6. Enables leadership to implement data-backed retention strategies<br>

• **Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

🔹 Key KPIs (Top Section)
- Total Employees
